**Enhancement 2: Navigation Redesign**


Focus: Optimizing Icon Placement for Better User Flow <br>

Problem: Search icon in bottom bar requires uncomfortable thumb stretch on larger phones <br>

Messages in top bar occupies premium space despite being a secondary action <br>

Poor ergonomics with most-used features not optimally placed <br>

Solution: Swap Search and Messages icons to align with natural usage patterns and ergonomic thumb zones.<br>

**Enhancement 3: Swipe Gesture Redesign**


Focus: Streamlined Navigation - Swipe Right to Feed <br>

Problem: Instagram's swipe-right gesture currently opens Messages, disrupting users who are actively browsing content and creating friction when accidentally triggered. <br>

Solution: Redirect the swipe-right gesture from Messages to Feed, allowing seamless navigation between different content views. <br>

Key Benefits: <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  🌊 Seamless Browsing Flow <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  🎯 Behavior-Aligned Navigation <br>

**Enhancement 4: Customizable Feed**


Focus: Personalized Content Discovery with Keyword Filters <br>

Location: Settings → Choose Your Feed <br>

Problem: Instagram's algorithm shows content based solely on past engagement, giving users no control over what appears in their feed. Users feel confused and overwhelmed. <br>

Solution: Keyword-based feed customization allows users to select topics of interest. Selected keywords appear as filterable pills at the top of the feed, enabling one-tap content filtering by topic.<br>

Key Benefits: <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  🎛️ User Control & Personalization <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ⚡ Instant Content Filtering <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  🧹 Reduced Content Clutter <br>

**Enhancement 5: Memories Feature**


Focus: Relive Your Instagram Journey with Automatic Memories <br>

Location: Messages Page <br>

Problem: Instagram has no built-in way to rediscover old content. Users must manually scroll through their entire profile to find past posts. <br>

Solution: Automatic Memories feature surfaces posts and stories from 1-2 years ago, allowing users to relive, reshare, and download nostalgic content effortlessly. <br>

Key Benefits: <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  🔄 Automatic Surfacing - Past moments appear without manual scrolling <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  📤 One-Tap Sharing - Share memories to Story with date stickers <br>
